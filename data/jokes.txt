They'd crack each other up!,What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!,Why did the math book look so sad? Because it had too many problems!,What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear!,Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts!,What did the ocean say to the beach? Nothing, it just waved!,Why did the bicycle fall over? Because it was two-tired!,What do you call a sleeping bull? A bulldozer!
